<!-- 
    I chose to use a pseudo-element for the top-left and bottom-right corners,
    and a div for the top-right and bottom-left corners.
    I did this because I wanted to show that it is possible to use both methods.
    I also use transform: rotate() to rotate the icon, because I wanted to show
    that it is possible to use it to rotate the icon and use a single image instead of 4.

    It's a bit advanced for this exercise, but it's possible to recreate the same effect
    using only img tags and position them with absolute positioning.

    It's also possibile use an helper class to avoid repeating the same position attributes.
