                    Luigi is a fictional character featured in video games and related media released by Nintendo.
                    Created by game designer <b>Shigeru Miyamoto</b>, Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller fraternal twin brother of Nintendo's mascot Mario and appears in many games throughout the Mario franchise,
                    often as a sidekick to his brother.
                    Luigi has appeared in over 200 video games since his creation,
                    including many Mario spin-offs and sports games.
                    He is also featured in Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Super Smash Bros.
                    as a playable character.
                    Luigi is portrayed as the more serious and reserved brother of the two,
                    while Mario is more of a joker.
                    Luigi is also more of a coward than his brother, and is often the one to be captured by the game's villain.
                    Luigi has been depicted as a plumber, a doctor, a ghost hunter, a racer, and a businessman.
