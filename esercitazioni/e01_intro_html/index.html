                    Luigi is a fictional character featured in video games and related media released by Nintendo.
                    Created by game designer <b>Shigeru Miyamoto</b>, Luigi is portrayed as the slightly younger but taller fraternal twin brother of Nintendo's mascot Mario and appears in many games throughout the Mario franchise,

                    while Mario is more of a joker.
                    Luigi is also more of a coward than his brother, and is often the one to be captured by the game's villain.
                    Luigi has been depicted as a plumber, a doctor, a ghost hunter, a racer, and a businessman.
